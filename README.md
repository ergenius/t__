# t__
Erlang gettext

Short story this library offers almost the same functionalities as [elixir-gettext](https://github.com/elixir-gettext/gettext) does but in a pure Erlang implementation.

[![Erlang CI](https://github.com/ergenius/t__/actions/workflows/erlang.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ergenius/t__/actions/workflows/erlang.yml)

t__ is also available on [HEX](https://hex.pm/packages/t__).

## Features
- ?T__("I have a joke about Erlang, but it requires a prologue.")
- Fast.
- Simple. Reading this file should be enough for understanding most use case scenarios.
- Documented source code with comments and specs.
- Higly configurable with multiple PO sources and languages per erlang application or process.
- Supports contexts.
- Supports interpolation using familiar Erlang format control sequences (from io:format).
- Supports translating singular term with or without interpolation and with or without context.
- Supports translating plural term with or without interpolation and with or without context.
- Supports all plural terms formulas defined by UNICODE CLDR.
- Supports ETS tables based caching.

## Limitations

- Gettext plural-forms formulas are hardcoded using a database. Work is underway to bypass this limitation and provide a full interpretor of any arbitrary gettext C formula.

## Usage

### Full demo application provided

You can find a full demo application on [Github t__ demoapp](https://github.com/ergenius/t__/tree/main/demoapp).
The application demonstrate most functionalities, including using multiple repositories and t__ being able to monitor repositories PO changes and reload them in real time. 
You can test this feature by modifying any PO files used by the demoapp while you run the application in console mode. A gen_server constinously translating strings on a timer is provided, so you can easily check the updates. 

### Set/get the calling process language

#### Set the language

It is higly recommended to set the calling process language in order to avoid specifying the language for each ?T__ macro call.
The specified language will be used by all ?T__ macros and functions for the current process if no explicit language is specified as a macro or function parameter.

```erlang
?T__LANGUAGE("en").
?T__LANGUAGE("en_GB").
?T__LANGUAGE("ro").
```

#### Get the language

Get the calling process language.

When you properly setup the language for the process, the expected time complexity for the current implementation
of this macro is O(1) and the worst case time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of items in the process dictionary.

The function will perform the following steps in order to determine the default language:
- call erlang:get(t__language)
- call application:get_env(t__language)
- call application:get_env(t__, t__language)
- if no t__language environment key was set for both the current application or the t__ application
we return t__ default language defined in t__.hrl file (wich is "en").

```erlang
Language = ?T__LANGUAGE().
```

### T__ macro examples

#### Singular terms

```erlang
?T__("I have a joke about Erlang, but it requires a prologue.").
```

You can use binaries and atoms, however it is not recommended.

```erlang
?T__(<<"Erlang is user-friendly, itâ€™s just picky about its friends!">>).
?T__('Why can\'t you trust atoms? Because they make up everything!').
```

#### Singular with context

Context is useful for the translators to distinguish in between identical strings.

```erlang
?T__({"menu", "Save"}).
?T__({"menu", "Quit"}).
?T__({"button", "Save"}).
?T__({"button", "Cancel"}).
```

Context can also be used to create proper translations based on grammatical gender.

```erlang
?T__({"female", "The cat belong to him/her"}).
?T__({"male", "The cat belong to him/her"}).
```

#### Singular with repository

Repositories are used to have different translations sources directories for the same application.
For example let's assume your application has many HTML templates, each with his own translation directory.

```erlang
?T__({"template1", {"Simple term from repository template1"}}).
?T__({"template2", {"Simple term from repository template2"}}).
```

Repository can be combined with context also.

```erlang
?T__({"template1", {"menu", "Save"}}).
```

#### Singular terms with interpolation

```erlang
?T__("~4.2f", [3.56]). 
```

#### Context for gramatical gender with interpolation

Context can also be used to create the proper translation based on grammatical gender combined with interpolation:

```erlang
?T__({"female", "Her/his name is ~s"}, ["Marry"]).
?T__({"male", "Her/his name is ~s"}, ["John"]).
```

#### Plural terms with interpolation:

```erlang
?T__(["~B user", "~B users"], [3]).
```

#### Plural terms with context and interpolation

```erlang
?T__({"female", ["~B file belongs to her/him", "~B files belong to her/him"]}, [3]).
?T__({"male", ["~B file belongs to her/him", "~B files belong to her/him"]}, [3]).
```

#### Plural terms with context, interpolation and repositories

```erlang
?T__({"template1", {"female", ["~B file belongs to her/him", "~B files belong to her/him"]}}, [3]).
?T__({"template1", {"male", ["~B file belongs to her/him", "~B files belong to her/him"]}}, [3]).
```

#### Translate using #t__p{} record

You can also specify everything using the #t__p{} record as a single parameter to the T__ macro.
This is actually the performance wise way of doing it. You will save some extra functions calls necessary
to understand your tuples. All #t__p{} fields except msg are optional.

```erlang
?T__(#t__p{msg = "Hello world"}).
?T__(#t__p{msg = "Her name is ~s", data = ["Marry"]}).
?T__(#t__p{language = "ro", context = "female", msg = "Her/his name is ~s", data = ["Marry"]}).
?T__(#t__p{repository = "module1", language = "ro", context = "male", msg = "Her/his name is ~s", data = ["John"]}).
?T__(#t__p{application=myapp, repository = "module1", language = "ro", context = "female", msg = "Her/his name is ~s", data = ["Marry"]}).
```

#### Macro with all possible parameters separated

For your convenience a macro also exists with all possible parameters:

```erlang
?T__(Application, Repository, Language, Context, Msg, Data).
```

## Plural formulas

### Is plural formula data correct?

Short answer: Yes, if you trust CLDR Project.

### How plural formulas where generated from CLDR?

For mantaining plural formulas database we started another project here: [gettext-po-samples](https://github.com/ergenius/gettext-po-samples)

We use the following sources and tools for compiling the database:

- [cldr.unicode.org](https://cldr.unicode.org/)
- [PHP gettext language list](https://github.com/php-gettext/Languages)
- [TranslateHouse](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/localization-guide/en/latest/l10n/pluralforms.html)

Formulas are automated generated by [PHP gettext language list](https://github.com/php-gettext/Languages) from CLDR. Each new release is manually checked and compared with the sources mentioned above. Data is compiled into [plural-forms.eterm](https://github.com/ergenius/gettext-po-samples/blob/main/data/plural-forms.eterm) file.
The same [plural-forms.eterm](https://github.com/ergenius/gettext-po-samples/blob/main/data/plural-forms.eterm) file is used to generate [src/t__plural.erl](src/t__plural.erl) file.

## Project roadmap

1. Continuously fixing bugs and tuning performance.
2. Writing more testing units.
3. Add more features.
